Step-by-Step Guide
Part 1: Set Up GitHub and Azure Repositories
Create a GitHub Repository

Go to GitHub and create a new repository for your project.
Provide necessary information such as repository name, description, and initialize with a readme if required.
Clone the GitHub Repository Locally

Clone the repository to your local development environment using Git.
Set Up Azure Repository

Log in to the Azure DevOps portal at https://dev.azure.com.
Create a new project within Azure DevOps to house the repository.
Create a new repository under this project, or link it to the existing GitHub repository.
Part 2: Branching and Feature Development
Branching Strategy
Decide on a branching strategy. A common practice is to use the main branch for production-ready code and create separate feature branches for new features or bug fixes.
Create a Feature Branch in GitHub
Create a new branch named feature-azure-setup from the main branch.
Push the branch to the GitHub repository if it’s created locally.
Part 3: Develop and Document Azure Setup
Document Azure Setup

In the feature-azure-setup branch, add a file named azure-setup.md.
Document the steps required to create an Azure account, set up a basic Azure VM, and deploy a sample Python script (e.g., a script that adds two numbers).
Ensure the documentation includes:
Steps to create an Azure account.
Steps to set up a basic Azure VM.
Steps to deploy the sample Python script.
Commit Your Changes

Commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message, e.g., Added Azure setup documentation.
Part 4: Push Changes and Create Pull Request
Push Changes to GitHub

Push your feature-azure-setup branch to the remote GitHub repository.
Create a Pull Request

Navigate to the GitHub repository.
Create a new pull request to merge feature-azure-setup into the main branch.
Provide a detailed description of the changes for context.
Part 5: Collaborative Review and Feedback
Add Collaborators

Add collaborators (team members) to review the pull request.
Ensure the reviewers have sufficient permissions to review and suggest changes.
Address Feedback

Review any feedback or comments provided by collaborators.
Make necessary changes and commit them to the feature-azure-setup branch.
Push the changes to update the pull request with the latest commits.
Approve and Merge

Once the reviewers approve the changes, merge the feature-azure-setup branch into the main branch.
Ensure the merge commit message clearly indicates the completion of the feature.
Part 6: Continuous Deployment Setup
Create Service Principal

In Azure, create a service principal (App Registration) and obtain the client ID, client secret, subscription ID, and tenant ID for authentication.
Configure GitHub Actions for Deployment

In your GitHub repository, navigate to the “Settings” section and add secrets for AZURE_CLIENT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET, AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID, and AZURE_TENANT_ID.
Set Up GitHub Actions Workflow

Create a GitHub Actions workflow file (e.g., .github/workflows/deploy.yml) in your repository to automate deployment to Azure.
Define steps for:
Authenticating to Azure using the secrets.
Deploying the changes from the main branch to the Azure VM.
Test the Workflow

Make a commit to the main branch to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow.
Verify that the workflow runs successfully and that the changes are deployed to the Azure VM.
Part 7: Verify and Ensure Stability
Verify Deployment

Verify that the deployment was successful by accessing the Azure VM and ensuring the Python script is running correctly.
Document Setup and Workflow Process

Update the azure-setup.md file to include information about the GitHub Actions workflow and deployment process.
Ensure the documentation is clear for future developers and team members.
By following these steps, you’ll be able to effectively set up a collaborative development environment with GitHub and Azure, ensuring clear documentation, efficient branching, and seamless deployment workflows. This approach ensures that all team members can collaborate effectively and deploy changes to Azure seamlessly.
