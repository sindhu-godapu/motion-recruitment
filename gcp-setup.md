Step-by-Step Guide
Part 1: Create GCP Account and Project
Sign Up for GCP

Visit the GCP website at https://cloud.google.com.
Sign up for a Google Cloud account.
Create a New Project

Once logged in, go to the Google Cloud Console at https://console.cloud.google.com.
Click the project dropdown at the top of the page and select "New Project".
Enter a project name and choose your billing account.
Click "Create" to create the project.
Part 2: Set Up a Basic GCP VM
Enable Necessary APIs

Navigate to the API Library in the Console.
Enable the "Compute Engine API".
Create a Virtual Machine

In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to "Compute Engine" and click on "VM instances".
Click on "Create instance".
Configure the VM instance:
Name your instance.
Choose a machine type (e.g., e2-micro if you're using the free tier).
Choose a region and zone based on your preference.
Under the Boot disk section, keep the default "Debian GNU/Linux" image.
Allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic.
Click on "Create" to launch the instance.
Connect to the VM

After the instance is created, use the SSH button in the GCP Console to connect to the instance.
Part 3: Develop and Deploy a Python Script
Install Python

Verify and install Python on your VM using appropriate commands.
Create a Python Script

Use an editor like nano or vim to create a Python script (e.g., add_two_numbers.py).
Write a simple Python script that adds two numbers and prints the result.
Run the Python Script

Execute the Python script to ensure it works correctly on the VM.
Part 4: Collaborative Development with GitHub
Clone GitHub Repository on VM

Clone your repository from GitHub to the GCP VM using Git commands.
Branching Strategy

Decide on a branching strategy (e.g., feature branches).
Create a branch named feature-gcp-setup.
Push Changes to GitHub

Add the Python script to your repository.
Commit and push your changes to the feature-gcp-setup branch.
Create a Pull Request

Create a pull request in GitHub to merge feature-gcp-setup into the main branch.
Add reviewers to the pull request for feedback.
Address Feedback and Merge

Review and address any feedback provided by collaborators.
Merge the pull request into the main branch once approved.
Part 5: Continuous Deployment Setup
Create a Service Account

In the GCP Console, navigate to "IAM & Admin" -> "Service Accounts".
Create a new service account with appropriate roles for your project.
Download the JSON key file for the service account.
Add GitHub Secrets

In your GitHub repository, go to "Settings" -> "Secrets".
Add the contents of the JSON key file as a secret (e.g., GCP_CREDENTIALS).
Add other required details such as the project ID as secrets (e.g., GCP_PROJECT_ID).
Create GitHub Actions Workflow

Create a GitHub Actions workflow file (e.g., .github/workflows/deploy.yml).
In this workflow, define steps to:
Authenticate with GCP using the secret.
Deploy the Python script to the VM or other GCP services (e.g., Cloud Functions, App Engine, etc.).
Test the Workflow

Push changes to the main branch to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow.
Verify that the deployment is successful and the Python script runs correctly in the GCP environment.
Part 6: Documentation and Final Integration
Document GCP Setup

In your repository, add or update the gcp-setup.md file.
Document all necessary steps for creating a GCP account, setting up a VM, deploying the Python script, and configuring continuous deployment with GitHub.
Final Review

Create a final review branch (e.g., feature-final-review).
Review all documentation and code changes for clarity and completeness.
Merge the final review branch back into the main branch.
Verify Main Branch

Ensure the main branch contains all relevant documentation and deployment setup.
Submission
Push All Changes
Ensure all changes are pushed to the GitHub repository.
Link to GitHub Repository
Provide the link to your repository for evaluation.
By following these steps, you will successfully set up a collaborative development environment using GCP and GitHub, ensuring effective deployment and seamless collaboration among team members. This approach ensures clarity, efficiency, and security throughout the setup and deployment processes.
